Hi, I'm [tanmaniac][gh-tanmanaic]. I'm a computer vision engineer; my work has been on visual odometry for self-driving cars, depth perception and depth completion, detection, tracking, and action recognition. These are disorganized, scattered notes from projects I've started and _might_ finish _eventually_.
